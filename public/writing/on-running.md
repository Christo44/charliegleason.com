  To all of the people who ran or walked for the Run For MS event today, you are champions. And a lot faster than I am.

  When I run, I run alone.

  It's a cathartic process - my feet against gravel beneath the pre-dawn sky, my churning breath, my pounding rhythm. Mostly I think about things. I think about today, and yesterday, and tomorrow. I wonder what happened to my primary school teachers and what I should cook for dinner. I secretly plan and plot, exploring new ideas and discarding old ones.

  I also sweat a lot.

  Today I participated in the 10km Run For MS, my first group running event. I lined up, a tiny bit drenched from (foolishly) riding across the city to be at Albert Park Lake before the 9am start.

  As I looked around, I felt giddy at the sheer number of people willing to drag themselves out of bed on a Sunday morning, bouncing from foot to foot to ward off the cold. I realised, very suddenly, that I'm never really running alone. That there are always people, secretly, running next to me, and behind me, and in front of me.

  Sometimes, when I'm making tiny bits of the internet, I forget that bit. I close myself off, and work in a tiny silo. I get scared to show people what I've made, or I think that someone cleverer than me will realise all the things that are wrong with it.

  But there will always be people running next to me, and behind me, and in front of me. All that really matters is that we're all in the race.

  Anyway, that's what I thought about today when I was running.
