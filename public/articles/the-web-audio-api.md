Being in a [band][band] can be pretty expensive.

It seems like it wouldn't be, in this digital age, but the reality is, it can be pretty expensive. Between studio hire, mixing, mastering, replication and distribution, it can still take a lot of people to get a song from your head to the wider universe. And that's just the music bit, without the marketing, PR and promotional costs involved in getting someone to actually listen to it.

I like the web as a tool for hacking. The idea of mashing together existing technologies into something greater than the sum of their parts. With the wealth of information on new API's, new tools and new processes, the web is a really lovely place to find inspiration and learn about new things.

Which is good, because I can never seem to pull together the Â£2,000 it would take to get a halfway decent video made.

When the going gets tough, get creative.

For our first single, [Preflight Nerves][preflight-nerves], I used the Twitter API and HTML5 video to make an interactive tweet-powered [giant internet karaoke session][preflight-nerves]. With over half a million views, the response was really wild, and I'm so proud of what it achieved. Afterwards, I felt a bit lost on what to do next, so we made a [really stripped back EP][the-greylings] while we took some time to regroup.
