    <p class="hero-strapline">I <em>really, really</em> like making the internet.</p>
    <p>I was a co-founder of the social film site <a href="#" title="Goodfilms lets you and your friends share movie reviews, keep a list of films to watch, and help you find where online you can legally stream your favourites.">Goodfil.ms</a>, and of the agency collective <a href="Codename are a team of highly experienced, award-winning digital designers and developers based in Melbourne, Australia.">Codename</a>.</p>
    <p>Previously I have worked as a technical lead and lead developer at a top Melbourne agency, and have taken on development and design roles in London, Perth and Melbourne. I have designed, built and managed everything from large-scale international projects through to small-scale labours of love.</p>

    <p>I work primarily with standards compliant HTML, progressively enhanced CSS, JavaScript / Coffeescript and Ruby / Rails. I am focused on accessible and usable front end development and back-end applications based around the MVC architecture. I have managed small and large teams, set up various internal processes for agencies and studios alike, balanced multiple third-party suppliers and implemented bespoke test plans with great success.</p>

    <p>I am a fast learner, and thrive in challenging environments that offers opportunities for professional growth. Mostly I want to surround myself with people who are as excited about the web as I am.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I like to work on micro projects, from tweet-based music videos to Arrested Development random episode selectors. I believe that few things can’t be solved with well-constructed semantic markup.</p>
