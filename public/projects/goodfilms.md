[Goodfilms](http://goodfil.ms) is a social film site, that lets you and your friends share movie reviews, keep a list of films to watch, and help you find where online you can legally stream your favourites.

I co-founded the site with Glen Maddern and John Barton, and it continues to help us, and our users, find better films to watch.
