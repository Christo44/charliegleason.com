I a big fan of Tommy Faith, having followed his blog [Sound Doctrine](http://sounddoc.net/) for a really long time.

When he got in touch and asked if I would been keen to help [Anatole](http://anatolemusic.com), from his [Teef Records](http://www.teefrecords.com/) label, to bring his EP to life I jumped at the opportuntity. I realised we could use [WebGL via Three.js](http://threejs.org/) to make a dynamic reprentation of the artwork that stayed true to the original direction.

It was a bunch of fun.
