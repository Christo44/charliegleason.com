I really, really like the artwork for Andrei Eremin's EP [Pale Blue](https://andreieremin.bandcamp.com/album/pale-blue), so when he approached me to collaborate on a site together I was thrilled to bring it to life.

As a grammy-nominated engineer, Andrei has worked on a huge number of recordsâ€”a list that is growing all the time. Backed by [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) and Rails, the site gives him the ability to manage, order and update his work based on his current needs.

We used Git to manage version control and deployments, meaning Andrei could easily make updates to text without having to fiddle with [FTP or anything horrible](http://charliegleason.com/articles/deploying-to-github-pages-with-gulp) like that.

With a focus on mobile-friendly features (I'm frowning at you, lazy loading) and gesture based navigation, the site lets the artwork of each release shine while embracing the aestetic of Andrei's brand.

Plus it was a lot of fun.
