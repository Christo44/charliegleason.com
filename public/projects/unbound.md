[Unbound](http://unbound.co.uk) is a [Rails-powered](http://rubyonrails.org/) crowdfunding platform connecting authors and readers. Authors present a pitch, readers pledge, and when the goal is reached the book is written. Over ten weeks I worked with the team at Unbound to relaunch the site, looking after design, front-end development and integration. 

You should absolutely [find a book to pledge](http://unbound.co.uk/books), and get involved.
