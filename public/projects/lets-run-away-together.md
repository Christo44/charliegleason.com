I love the ease of using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so I built a blog to enable super fast posting of things I like.

I focussed on working within the limitations of that tool chain, which means no compilation step before deployment, and no fancy features (like autoprefixer). Ultimately, I wanted to be able to make changes direct to **Github**, without needing to compile it locally.
