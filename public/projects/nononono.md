[Nononono](http://charlie.nononono.co) started as No More Gifs, a ten minute microsite to try and persude people away from the incredible gif. It was tounge in cheek (I love a gif as much as the next internet enthusiast) and didn't go anywhere. Then I realised there was something in the idea of being able to say no more anything.

Feed it a sub-domain, like [kittens](http://kittens.nononono.co) or [Harlem Shake](http://harlem-shake.nononono.co) or [hipsters](http://hipsters.nononono.co) and it will proudly proclaim its derision, using an iconic scene from the Office.

There are some [easter eggs](http://trolling.nononono.co) in there as well.

It was built with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and makes pretty extensive use of [flex box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes).
