The Brightly website is, at its core, a social aggregator. Pulling content from [Tumblr](http://tumblr.wearebrightly.com), [Flickr](http://flickr.com/wearebrightly/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wearebrightly) and [Google Calendar](http://gigs.wearebrightly.com/), the hub acts as a portal to all the band's projects, releases and upcoming gigs.

Powered by [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), it shows how easily content from third parties can be seamlessly integrated into a larger site.
