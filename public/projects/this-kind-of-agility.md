I love Arrested Development, and so do the folks at [Codename](http://codename.io). Having watched every episode an absurd number of times, we started hacking on scripts to randomly choose one.

Instead we built a responsive site to do it for us, and hooked into the Netflix API to view to an episode directly. 

Phew.
