[We](http://codename.io) worked with [Trova](http://trova.com.au) to design and build the front-end on a new Australian based shopping style discoverery engine. Using a custom grid system, we rolled the site across a number of breakpoints and devices to ensure it looked good no matter what it was viewed on.

I'm thrilled that the design has continued to develop since we completed the project while maintaining the style and language of the original direction.

So what are you waiting for? [Go shopping.](http://trova.com.au)
