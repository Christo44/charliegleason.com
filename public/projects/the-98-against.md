I [read a tweet by Brendan Maclean](https://twitter.com/macleanbrendan/status/248417369955917824) on the same sex marriage bill that was in the Australian Parliament, and I realised he was right. So I built [The 98 Against](http://the98against.com) (and it's sibling, [The 42 Against](http://the42against.com)) as a response.

By screen scraping the Parliamentary website, I was able to provide a single place to contact all of the appropriate parliamentary members who voted against the bill. Armchair activism ahoy!

[Esperanto Magazine](http://issuu.com/esperanto.magazine/docs/digital_edition_for_online/28) interviewed me about it and everything.
