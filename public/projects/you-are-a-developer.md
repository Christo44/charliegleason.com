In 2012 I spoke at [Web Direction South](http://south12.webdirections.org/) on moving from design to development. As a part of my talk, I put together a companion site, called [You Are A Developer, The Internet Is Your Friend](http://wds12.charliegleason.com/) which featured all the topics I covered.

The [Github repo](https://github.com/superhighfives/wds12) is available, too. It was built with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and [HAML](http://haml.info/).

You can also [watch the talk](http://www.webdirections.org/resources/you-are-a-developer-video-presentation-from-charlie-gleason/), which was featured on the [Web Directions](http://www.webdirections.org/) site.
