In August 2013, I went to Istanbul. While there, I saw cats. Loads and loads of them. There were big ones and little ones and old ones and sick ones and funny ones. They were on every street, in every corner.

So over the next five days I took photos of them, and when I got home [I made them a website](http://catsofistanbul.charliegleason.com/).

Powered by [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/), the site includes a custom image preloader, a bunch of CSS3 transitions and 40 individually geolocated kitties.

These are the cats of Istanbul.
