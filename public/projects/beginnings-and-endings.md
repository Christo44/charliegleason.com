When we finished recording our debut album, we realised we didn't really know how to get people to share it. [Beginnings & Endings](http://beginnings.wearebrightly.com/) is a response to that. I wanted to create a way to track and celebrate fandom.

When you sign up, you get the single [Preflight Nerves](http://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/) for free, along with a unique code. If ten of your friends join in using your code, you get the album free. Meanwhile, the site tracks every km the song travels and adds them all up. It has, so far, travelled over 800,000km.

We pitched it as being a bit like a pyramid scheme, but without the bad bits.
