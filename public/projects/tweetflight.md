A real-time interactive [Twitter-powered film clip](http://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/) for my band [Brightly](http://wearebrightly.com/), which has been viewed over 300,000 times.

It won the [FWA Site of the Day](http://www.thefwa.com/site/tweetflight), the [Awwwards Site of the Day](http://www.awwwards.com/web-design-awards/tweetflight), and was featured on the [Google Showcase](http://www.google.com/think/campaigns/brightly-tweetflight.html). It also made the front page of [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org/) for three days.

It was a pretty successful project.
